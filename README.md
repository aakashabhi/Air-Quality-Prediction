# Air-Quality-Prediction

Predicting Pollution Levels using Machine Learning.
The dataset consists of five features of the air he collected which can be used to predict the air quality index.

The model used for prediction is Multifeature Linear Regression (**MLR**) Model that gave a Variance score of 0.96 after training.

**Train.csv:-** The train data consists of five feature columns and one target column. All the feature
columns are numeric and target value is also numeric.

**Test.csv:**- Test data consist all the columns contained by train with the exception of target column
which is to be predicted using the model trained on train data.

**submission.csv-** Consists of the predictions made by the model  trained along with the corresponding features.
